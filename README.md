# RFM Model Analysis

## Overview

This repository provides a Python implementation of the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis model. RFM is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors, helping businesses to better target their efforts.

### Key Concepts:

- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary Value**: How much money a customer has spent in total.
